## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework

### What I learned

Gatsby is a React-based tool that can be used to build static sites. Gatsby can generate a static site by reading data from an internal GraphQL database. There are several source plugins available that can populate data into Gatsby's GraphQL database. You may also write your own source plugin.

### Useful resources
